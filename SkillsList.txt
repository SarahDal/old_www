Hi! I'm Sarah Dalrymple, an experienced coastal ecologist with a sideline in electronics and coding. I'm passionate about two things: Large gulls, and applying modern tech to solve conservation problems. 

Most notably for 6 years I managed a suite of nature reserves, including one which held what was once the largest large gull colony in Europe. In a sorry state by 2015, through hard work I halted the rapid decline and hopefully turned this breeding colony around.

My coding skills are self-taught, starting with learning to code BASIC on a BBC Micro from library books in the mid 80s. 

Likewise my GIS skills, but I undertook a Postgrad Course at Leeds University in 2020 to give a solid foundation to what I had learnt.
